## Agent Initialization

Display "=== Summarization Agent<<ID>> Starting ===".

## Input Text Retrieval

Retrieve {{input_text}}.

## Lie Detection Determination

Retrieve {{lie_probability}}.

Execute probabilistic determination:
```bash
uv run python -c "import random; print(1 if random.random() < {{lie_probability}} else 0)"
```

Save the determination result to {{agent_<<ID>>_lie_flag}}.

Display "Agent<<ID>>: Lie probability {{lie_probability}} ‚Üí Determination result {{agent_<<ID>>_lie_flag}}".
