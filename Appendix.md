## A.1: System Control via Claude Code Slash Commands

When agents perform tasks, they need to be mindful of resource constraints (budget, API call limits, time allowances, computational costs, etc.). Real-world agents do not possess infinite resources, and cost-conscious decision-making under resource constraints is essential for practical systems.

### What are Slash Commands?

**Slash commands** are special commands in Claude Code that begin with "/". They can be executed directly during natural language conversations and enable checking and controlling Claude Code's system state. Unlike traditional command-line operations, they can be executed seamlessly within the flow of dialogue.

#### Main Built-in Commands

Claude Code provides the following built-in slash commands:

- `/help` - Display list and descriptions of available commands
- `/clear` - Reset conversation history and context (memory optimization)
- `/model` - Switch between Claude models (Opus/Sonnet, etc.)
- `/ide` - Check IDE integration status (open files, linter errors, etc.)
- `/permissions` - Manage tool allowlists


### Key Points

**1. Actual System Information Retrieval**
- Real-time development environment status checking via `/ide`
- Dynamic discovery of available functions via `/help`
- Decision-making based on actual system state

**2. Dynamic Environment Control**
- Timely memory management via `/clear`
- Optimization according to processing characteristics via `/model`
- Dynamic adjustment based on performance requirements

**3. Integration with Conditional Branching**
- Processing branches based on system state
- Determining next actions based on execution results
- Practical workflow automation

The use of slash commands enables practical agent design that leverages Claude Code's system capabilities.

## A.2: Event-Driven Execution and System Integration

Many processes in the real world occur asynchronously. Systems that can immediately respond to external stimuli such as file creation, email reception, and sensor value changes are required to have high responsiveness. Event-Driven execution is a primitive that asynchronously listens for specific events and executes corresponding tasks when detected.

### What is Event-Driven?

**Event-Driven execution** is an execution model that starts tasks asynchronously triggered by external events, in contrast to Sequential Pipeline which is synchronous. Agents monitor events in a waiting state and automatically begin processing when specific conditions are met.

### External Trigger Model

The most practical and robust approach is a hybrid design that delegates event monitoring to existing proven technologies and allows the LLM to focus on post-trigger processing.

#### Main Implementation Technology Examples

**1. Time Triggers with cron**
- Automatic invocation at specified times
- Basic implementation method for scheduled tasks

**2. File Monitoring with watchdog**
- File system monitoring using Python's watchdog library
- Detection of file creation, modification, and deletion events
- Continuous monitoring of specified directories with immediate response

**3. inotify System**
- Linux native file system monitoring functionality
- Efficient event detection at low level

### Integration Patterns

Typical integration example: "Continuously monitor directory `/orders`, and when a new file (e.g., `order123.json`) is created, evaluate `order_processing.md` with that file path as an argument" by running a resident script.

### Key Points

**1. Asynchronous Processing Implementation**
- Immediate response to external events
- Parallel monitoring of multiple events
- Improved system-wide responsiveness

**2. Flexibility in Technology Selection**
- Choice of monitoring technology according to requirements
- Easy integration with existing systems
- Adaptability to operational environments

**3. Integration with Macro Files**
- Separation of event information and processing logic
- Dynamic modification of processing content
- Construction of reusable processing patterns

Event-Driven execution enables the construction of agent systems with high responsiveness for real-time systems and business automation.

## A.3: Risk Mitigation Strategies for Important Tasks

### Background and Challenge Recognition

Natural Language Macro Programming is expected to be utilized across diverse fields due to its intuitiveness and high explainability. However, due to uncertainties derived from the probabilistic behavioral characteristics of LLMs (Large Language Models), appropriate risk mitigation strategies are necessary for high-importance tasks.

**Characteristics and Challenges of Probabilistic Systems**:
- Difficulty in guaranteeing 100% operational reliability in principle (probabilistic operating system)
- Possibility of unexpected interpretations or execution results
- Need for careful operation in important business processes
- Clarification of application scope and recognition of limitations

**Purpose of This Section**:
Assuming the nature of probabilistic systems, to achieve safe and responsible utilization of natural language macro programming for important business tasks through a three-layer defense strategy (proactive design prevention, runtime error handling, auditing and continuous improvement).

### Layer 1: Proactive Design Measures (Proactive Design)

Incorporate risk reduction mechanisms in advance during the workflow design stage.

#### 1. Strategic Placement of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

**Approval Gate Design at Critical Points**:

```markdown
## Approval Process for Critical Decisions
Please review the following processing content:
{{proposed_action}}

This process includes irreversible changes.
Please respond with "Approved" or "Revision Required".
Will not proceed to next step without approval.

Save approval result to {{human_approval}}.

## Safety Control through Conditional Branching
Only when {{human_approval}} is "Approved":
Execute critical_operation.md

Otherwise:
Stop processing and transition to revision pending state.
```

**Implementation Points**:
- Must be placed immediately before irreversible operations (file deletion, external API calls, financial transactions, etc.)
- Utilize "Approval Waiting Pattern" from "Human-in-the-Loop" pattern
- Predefine clear approval and rejection criteria

#### 2. Graceful Degradation Design

Design that continues to provide limited but valuable service when ideal conditions are not available, rather than immediately stopping the system.

```markdown
## Staged Alternative Processing for API Connections
Try the following process:
Retrieve latest data from external API and save to {{latest_data}}

If it fails (Catch):
Retrieve latest available data from local cache and save to {{cached_data}}
Set warning "Note: Data is from {{cache_date}}" to {{warning}}

Finally:
Continue analysis using {{latest_data}} or {{cached_data}}
Include {{warning}} in results if quality degradation warning exists
```

#### 3. Execution Permission Minimization

Minimize permissions granted to the system and implement strict access control for functions involving risks.

```markdown
## Permission Control Implementation Example
/permissions Allow file reading and text generation only

When dangerous command execution is required:
"This operation requires system administrator privileges.
Request manual execution by administrator."
Pause processing and wait for human intervention
```

### Layer 2: Runtime Error Handling

Prevent the system from falling into catastrophic states when unexpected errors occur.

#### 1. Redundancy through Try-Catch-Finally

```markdown
## Robust External Integration Processing
Try the following process:
Retrieve important data from main API

If it fails (Catch):
Retrieve similar data from backup API
Record that source is different in {{data_source_warning}}

If backup also fails (Catch):
Search existing database for available alternative data
Set "Data freshness is limited" to {{limitation_note}}

Finally:
Clearly record retrieved data and its limitations
Report quality level along with processing results
```

#### 2. State Persistence and Recovery Mechanisms

Address the risk of process interruption, especially for long-running tasks.

```markdown
## Design for Interruptible Long-term Processing
Save progress to progress_state.json at each stage of long-term tasks:

Upon Step 1 completion:
{"completed_steps": ["data_collection"], "current_step": "analysis", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"}

Upon Step 2 completion:
{"completed_steps": ["data_collection", "analysis"], "current_step": "report_generation", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T11:45:00Z"}

## Recovery Processing
Check progress_state.json and resume processing from last completed step
Record "Processing resumed from {{timestamp}}" in log
```

### Layer 3: Auditing and Continuous Improvement

Record and analyze system behavior to reduce future risks.

#### 1. Log Recording Examples

```markdown
## Create Audit Log for All Processing
At execution start:
{"timestamp": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z", "action": "process_start", "user_input": "{{original_request}}", "system_state": "{{initial_state}}"}

During Human-in-the-Loop intervention:
{"timestamp": "2025-01-15T09:15:00Z", "action": "human_intervention", "decision": "{{human_decision}}", "rationale": "{{human_rationale}}", "context": "{{decision_context}}"}

When error occurs:
{"timestamp": "2025-01-15T09:30:00Z", "action": "error_occurred", "error_type": "{{error_type}}", "error_message": "{{error_details}}", "recovery_action": "{{recovery_method}}"}

Persist all logs to audit_log.json
```

#### 2. Utilizing Learning from Experience

```markdown
## Converting Failure Patterns to Learning Data
Update learning database when errors occur:

Record in failure_patterns.json:
{
  "error_type": "API_timeout",
  "context": "high_traffic_period",
  "failed_action": "external_data_fetch",
  "successful_recovery": "switch_to_cached_data",
  "lesson_learned": "Prioritize cached data from the start during high traffic periods"
}

In similar situations next time:
Check past failure patterns and proactively use cached data
"Selected safe alternative based on past learning"
```

Understanding the probabilistic characteristics of natural language macro programming and implementing appropriate risk mitigation measures enables safe and responsible utilization across diverse fields.
