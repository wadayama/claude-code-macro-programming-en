# Theme Generation

Generate {{agent_count}} creative and strange haiku themes. Focus on unique and interesting concepts rather than seasonal or natural elements.

Output each theme in the following format:
1. [Theme 1]
2. [Theme 2]
(Continue up to {{agent_count}} themes)

Output only the themes, no additional explanation needed.

## Theme Distribution

Distribute the generated themes to each agent:

Save the {{agent_count}} themes in the following format:
- Save the 1st theme to {{agent_1_theme}}
- Save the 2nd theme to {{agent_2_theme}}
- Save the 3rd theme to {{agent_3_theme}}
- Save the 4th theme to {{agent_4_theme}}
- Save the 5th theme to {{agent_5_theme}}

(If {{agent_count}} is not 5, save up to the corresponding number in {{agent_N_theme}} format)

Save all themes to {{themes}}.
