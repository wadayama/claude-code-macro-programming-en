# Claude Code Natural Language Macro Programming Guide

> üåè **Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà„ÇÇÂà©Áî®ÂèØËÉΩ**: [Japanese documentation is available here](https://github.com/wadayama/claude-code-macro-programming) (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„Éâ„Ç≠„É•„É°„É≥„Éà„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ)

A guide to building agent systems using **Claude Code** as a natural language interpreter.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Try variable storage and reference:

**Store in variable**:
```
"Create 3 haiku poems about spring and save to {{haiku}}"
```

**Reference variable**:
```
"Select the most beautiful one from {{haiku}} and refine it"
```

Execute these directly in Claude Code to experience natural language macro programming.
(Note: CLAUDE.md macro definition is required)

## üéØ 10 Design Patterns

The core of natural language macro programming consists of 10 design patterns, systematically organized into **4 Basic Patterns** and **6 Advanced Patterns**.

### üìã Basic 4 Patterns - [macro.md](./macro.md)

- **[Pattern 1: Sequential Pipeline](./macro.md#pattern-1-sequential-pipeline)** - Basic execution pattern that processes tasks sequentially, passing results from one stage to the next
- **[Pattern 2: Parallel Processing](./macro.md#pattern-2-parallel-processing)** - Parallel execution pattern that runs multiple tasks simultaneously for efficient processing
- **[Pattern 3: Conditional Execution](./macro.md#pattern-3-conditional-execution)** - Conditional branching pattern that selects different processing paths based on situations
- **[Pattern 4: Loop & Modular Programming](./macro.md#pattern-4-loop--modular-programming)** - Efficient repetitive control through TODO-list based iteration and Few-shot Pattern Loop

### üöÄ Advanced 6 Patterns - [macro.md](./macro.md)

- **[Pattern 5: Problem Solving & Recursion](./macro.md#pattern-5-problem-solving--recursion)** - Recursive approach that breaks down complex problems step by step and solves them through TODO management
- **[Pattern 6: Learning from Experience](./macro.md#pattern-6-learning-from-experience)** - Experience learning pattern that learns from past execution results and generates improvement suggestions
- **[Pattern 7: Environment Sensing, Knowledge-base & Environment Model](./macro.md#pattern-7-environment-sensing-knowledge-base-and-environment-model)** - Acquires external environment information, builds knowledge systems, and executes adaptive processing according to situations
- **[Pattern 8: Human-in-the-Loop](./macro.md#pattern-8-human-in-the-loop-hitl)** - Collaborative execution pattern that incorporates human judgment at appropriate timings
- **[Pattern 9: Error Handling](./macro.md#pattern-9-error-handling)** - Robustness improvement pattern that predicts errors and executes appropriate recovery processing
- **[Pattern 10: Debug & Tracing](./macro.md#pattern-10-debug--tracing)** - Development support pattern that visualizes execution status and assists in problem identification and resolution

### üîß Pattern Utilization and Integration

**Structure**: Combine Pattern 1-4 (Basic Patterns) and Pattern 5-10 (Advanced Patterns), along with Appendix (Specialized Technologies) to build practical systems.

**Integration Effects**: By combining multiple patterns, collaborative systems like the **A.4 Haiku Generation Multi-Agent** can be constructed.

### üìñ Appendix (Advanced Technologies) - [Appendix.md](./Appendix.md)

- **[A.1: Event-Driven Execution](./Appendix.md#a1-event-driven-execution)** - Asynchronous processing and real-time response systems

- **[A.5: Audit Log System](./Appendix.md#a5-audit-log-system)** - Transparency and accountability tracking via SQLite variable management extension
- **[A.6: LLM-based Pre-execution Inspection](./Appendix.md#a6-llm-based-pre-execution-inspection)** - LLM-powered pre-execution static analysis for security and quality assurance
- **[A.7: Metaprogramming](./Appendix.md#a7-metaprogramming)** - Self-adaptive systems through dynamic macro generation, verification, evaluation, and improvement
- **[A.8: Ensemble Execution and Consensus Formation](./Appendix.md#a8-ensemble-execution-and-consensus-formation)** - Statistical countermeasures for probabilistic behavior

- **[A.10: LLM-based Post-execution Evaluation](./Appendix.md#a10-llm-based-post-execution-evaluation)** - Quality, creativity, and logic evaluation for probabilistic systems
- **[A.11: Variable Management Persistence and Scaling](./Appendix.md#a11-variable-management-persistence-and-scaling-database-utilization)** - Robust state management via databases
- **[A.12: Vector Database and RAG Utilization](./Appendix.md#a12-vector-database-and-rag-utilization)** - Dynamic knowledge systems through knowledge bases and experience learning
