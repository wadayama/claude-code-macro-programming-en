# Claude Code Natural Language Macro Programming Guide

A guide to building agent systems using **Claude Code** as a natural language interpreter.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Try variable storage and reference:

**Store in variable**:
```
"Create 3 haiku poems about spring and save to {{haiku}}"
```

**Reference variable**:
```
"Select the most beautiful one from {{haiku}} and refine it"
```

Execute these directly in Claude Code to experience natural language macro programming.
(Note: CLAUDE.md macro definition is required)

## üéØ Overview

**10 Design Patterns**
- Basic Processing Patterns (Sequential, Parallel, Conditional, Loop)
- Advanced Patterns (Problem Solving, Learning from Experience, Environment Understanding, Human Collaboration, Error Handling, Debug)

**Appendix: Implementation Technologies**
- A.1: System Control via Claude Code Slash Commands
- A.2: Event-Driven Execution
- A.3: Risk Mitigation Strategies for Important Tasks
- A.4: Python Tool Integration
- A.5: Multi-Agent System Design (variables.json blackboard model)
- A.6: Audit Log System (transparency and accountability tracking)
- A.7: LLM-based Verification System (LLM-powered pre-execution static analysis for security)
- A.8: Metaprogramming (dynamic macro generation, verification, evaluation, and improvement)
- A.9: Ensemble Execution and Consensus Formation (statistical countermeasures for probabilistic behavior)
- A.10: Type Safety and Schema Management (gradual type safety enhancement and schema-based systematic data management)

**Practical Applications**
- Haiku generation, blog creation, investment decision support systems
- Business automation methodologies
