  - Partner organization representatives (3 people)
  - Employee representatives from different levels (2 people)
- **Method**: Individual interviews (45 minutes each) + Focus group session (90 minutes)
- **Implementation Period**: Research week 2-3
- **Budget**: $2,000 (facilitator fees, venue, materials)

## Phase 1: Initial Project Decomposition

### Main Task Analysis

**Main Task**: "Corporate Annual Conference Complete Planning"

**Complexity Assessment**: Extremely high complexity requiring decomposition

**Initial Decomposition**: Based on stakeholder research, divide into major project areas:

1. **Strategic Planning & Content Design** - Priority: Critical
2. **Venue & Logistics Management** - Priority: High  
3. **Marketing & Communications** - Priority: High
4. **Technology & Digital Infrastructure** - Priority: Medium
5. **Catering & Hospitality Services** - Priority: Medium
6. **Budget Management & Financial Control** - Priority: Critical

### TODO List Initialization

Add the following first-level tasks to TODO list:

1. "Strategic Planning & Content Design" - Priority: Critical, Status: Pending
2. "Venue & Logistics Management" - Priority: High, Status: Pending
3. "Marketing & Communications" - Priority: High, Status: Pending  
4. "Technology & Digital Infrastructure" - Priority: Medium, Status: Pending
5. "Catering & Hospitality Services" - Priority: Medium, Status: Pending
6. "Budget Management & Financial Control" - Priority: Critical, Status: Pending

## Phase 2: Recursive Decomposition Processing

### Task Processing Framework

For each pending task, apply the following recursive decision logic:

#### Decomposition Decision Criteria:
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Can this be executed by a single team within 2 weeks?
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Does this task have internal dependencies requiring sequencing?
3. **Resource Requirements**: Does this need specialized skills or significant budget allocation?
4. **Risk Level**: What are the consequences if this task is not properly planned?

#### Processing Each Critical Priority Task

**Process "Strategic Planning & Content Design"**:

Mark as in_progress.

**Decomposition Assessment**:
- Complexity: Very high - involves multiple content streams and stakeholder alignment
- Dependencies: High - affects all other planning areas
- Resources: Requires senior leadership involvement and external speakers
- Risk: Critical - poor content planning affects entire event success

**Decomposition Decision**: Further decompose

**Second-level decomposition**:
Add the following subtasks to TODO:
1. "Keynote Speaker Selection & Contracting" - Priority: Critical
2. "Breakout Session Topic Development" - Priority: High
3. "Workshop & Training Content Planning" - Priority: Medium
4. "Networking Activities Design" - Priority: Medium

Mark "Strategic Planning & Content Design" as completed (decomposition completed).

**Process "Budget Management & Financial Control"**:

Mark as in_progress.

**Decomposition Assessment**:
- Complexity: High - involves multiple budget categories and approval processes
- Dependencies: Affects all other tasks - budget allocations needed before execution
- Resources: Requires finance team and executive approval
- Risk: Critical - budget overruns or shortfalls affect entire project

**Decomposition Decision**: Further decompose

**Second-level decomposition**:
Add the following subtasks to TODO:
1. "Budget Category Allocation & Limits" - Priority: Critical
2. "Vendor Contract Negotiation Framework" - Priority: High
3. "Financial Reporting & Tracking System" - Priority: High
4. "Contingency Planning & Risk Reserves" - Priority: Medium

Mark "Budget Management & Financial Control" as completed (decomposition completed).

## Phase 3: Continue Recursive Processing

Please continue processing all remaining pending tasks using the same recursive logic:

1. Assess each pending task for complexity, dependencies, resources, and risk
2. Either execute directly (if manageable) or decompose further
3. Update TODO list with appropriate status changes
4. Continue until all tasks are either completed or executable units

## Phase 4: Parallel Execution Planning

Once decomposition is complete, organize executable tasks into parallel work streams:

**Critical Path Tasks** (must be sequential):
- Budget allocation → Venue booking → Speaker contracting

**Parallel Workstreams** (can run simultaneously):
- Marketing materials development
- Technology setup and testing
- Catering menu planning and arrangements

Create execution timeline with dependencies clearly mapped.

## Phase 5: Integration and Verification

### Final Project Integration

Gather all completed task outputs and create comprehensive conference plan including:
- Complete event schedule and content agenda
- Detailed budget allocation and vendor contracts
- Marketing and communication timeline
- Technology requirements and setup procedures
- Risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans

Save integrated plan to {{conference_master_plan}}.

### Quality Verification Process

Verify the integrated plan against original stakeholder requirements:
1. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Does plan meet research-identified needs?
2. **Budget Compliance**: Are all costs within $120,000 budget?
3. **Feasibility Assessment**: Are timelines and resources realistic?
4. **Risk Coverage**: Are major risks identified and mitigated?

## Phase 6: Project Management Reflection

Evaluate the recursive problem-solving process:

1. **Decomposition Effectiveness**: How did recursive breakdown improve planning quality?
2. **TODO Management**: How did structured task tracking improve project control?
3. **Integration Success**: How well do decomposed elements work together?
4. **Constraint Management**: How effectively were budget and resource constraints handled?

**Advanced Problem Solving & Recursion Features**:
1. **Multi-constraint Optimization**: Budget, time, and resource constraints shape decomposition decisions
2. **Dynamic Priority Management**: Task priorities adjust based on dependencies and risk assessment
3. **Parallel Processing Integration**: Recursive decomposition enables parallel execution planning
4. **Stakeholder-driven Requirements**: Decomposition guided by actual user research and needs analysis
5. **Real-world Complexity**: Demonstrates handling of realistic project management challenges

This intermediate example shows how Problem Solving & Recursion can manage complex, real-world projects with multiple constraints, dependencies, and stakeholder requirements while maintaining systematic progress toward comprehensive solutions.
