# üìù Learning from Experience Beginner: Writing Style Analysis & Improvement System

**System Overview**: Learning system that accumulates writing experience and progressively improves writing skills through style analysis

**Learning Objectives**: 
- Recording and accumulating writing experience through JSON persistence
- Discovering style analysis and improvement points
- Enhancing document quality using past experience

---

## Phase 1: Initial Writing Experiment

Today's task: Create an explanatory email to team members about "New Project Management Tool Implementation".

### Writing Conditions
Please create an email with a natural writing style that includes the following content:
- Overview explanation of new tool "TeamFlow"
- Reasons for implementation and benefits
- Request for team cooperation

Write without special constraints, using your usual writing style.

### Document Evaluation
Please evaluate the created document from the following perspectives (1-10 points):
- **Friendliness**: Distance with team members
- **Readability**: Clarity of the writing
- **Persuasiveness**: Convincing power for implementation
- **Efficiency**: Clarity of key points

Please also calculate an overall evaluation.

## Phase 2: Experience Recording and Analysis

Please save writing experience to writing_memory.json file for persistence with the following structure:

```json
{
  "writing_experiences": [
    {
      "date": "today",
      "document_type": "explanatory email",
      "topic": "project management tool implementation",
      "style_analysis": {
        "formality_level": "analyze formality/honorific level of created document",
        "tone": "analyze atmosphere and tone of document",
        "sentence_structure": "analyze characteristics of sentence structure",
        "vocabulary": "analyze characteristics of vocabulary used"
      },
      "scores": {
        "friendliness": "friendliness score",
        "readability": "readability score",
        "persuasiveness": "persuasiveness score",
        "efficiency": "efficiency score"
      },
      "identified_problems": [
        "list identified problems"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": "lessons learned from this experience"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Improvement Practice

Please load writing_memory.json and set to {{past_writing_experience}}.

Analyze the lessons and problems from {{past_writing_experience}}, and recreate the same content with improved writing style.

Improvement strategy:
- Solve identified problems
- More friendly and efficient expressions
- Structure considering reader's perspective

### Evaluation of Improvement Results
Please evaluate the improved version from the same 4 perspectives and compare with the initial version.

---

## Phase 4: Recording Improvement Results

Please add improvement results to {{past_writing_experience}} and update writing_memory.json:

```json
{
  "date": "today (improved version)",
  "document_type": "explanatory email", 
  "topic": "project management tool implementation",
  "style_analysis": {
    "post-improvement style analysis"
  },
  "scores": {
    "post-improvement scores"
  },
  "identified_improvements": [
    "list implemented improvements"
  ],
  "lessons_learned": "new lessons learned from improvement process"
}
```

---

## Phase 5: Learning Outcome Analysis

Please analyze the following from accumulated {{past_writing_experience}}:

### Score Comparison Analysis
Please conduct score comparison between initial and improved versions, and quantitatively evaluate improvement effects.

### Extraction of Effective Techniques
Please identify specific techniques used in improvement and organize them for future use.

### Creation of General Guidelines
From this experience, please create general improvement guidelines for team internal communication documents.

## Learning Completion

Display "Learning from Experience basic cycle completed!" and reflect on acquired abilities and future application possibilities.

## System Cleanup

For next execution, please delete the writing_memory.json file.
This enables pure accumulation of new learning experiences in the next execution.

**Learning from Experience Pattern Characteristics**:
1. **Experience Persistence**: JSON files maintain learning history across sessions
2. **Iterative Improvement**: Each cycle builds upon previous lessons learned
3. **Quantitative Tracking**: Numerical scores enable progress measurement
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Analysis identifies recurring improvement opportunities
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Lessons learned become reusable guidelines

This example demonstrates how Learning from Experience enables continuous skill development through systematic capture, analysis, and application of experience data.
