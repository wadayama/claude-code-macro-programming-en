## üîç Learning Points

### Core of Learning from Experience Pattern
1. **JSON File Storage**: `Save {{variable_name}} to filename.json`
2. **Experience Accumulation**: Systematic recording of past trial results
3. **Knowledge Utilization**: Logical inference from accumulated experience
4. **Continuous Learning**: Iterative improvement through combination with Loop Pattern

**Learning from Experience Pattern Applications**:
1. **Persistent Memory**: JSON files enable learning across multiple sessions
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Each execution builds upon previous learnings
3. **Quantitative Progress**: Measurable improvement through scoring systems
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Systems learn to identify effective strategies
5. **Meta-learning**: Learning how to learn and improve performance

These examples demonstrate the power of Learning from Experience in creating systems that continuously improve their own effectiveness through structured experimentation and knowledge accumulation.
