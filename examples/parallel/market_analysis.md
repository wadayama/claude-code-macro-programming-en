**Learning Points**:
- Simultaneous execution of 3 independent tasks
- Saving each task's results to individual variables
- Comprehensive analysis through integration of parallel execution results
- Practical content using actual market data
- Understanding basic patterns of Parallel Processing

**Parallel Processing Pattern Characteristics**:
1. **Task Independence**: Each analysis task can be executed independently without dependencies
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Multiple research streams running simultaneously
3. **Data Aggregation**: Final integration synthesizes parallel results
4. **Scalability**: Additional analysis dimensions can be easily added as new parallel tasks

This example demonstrates how Parallel Processing enables efficient market research by conducting multiple analyses simultaneously, reducing overall execution time while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
