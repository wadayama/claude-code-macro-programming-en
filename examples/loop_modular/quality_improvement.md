# Quality Improvement System (Intermediate)

**Overview**: TODO-list based conditional loop processing aimed at progressive quality score improvement. A practical system that continues improvement processes until goal achievement and automatically terminates when conditions are met.

**Learning Objectives**: 
- Understanding conditional TODO-list based loops
- Implementing dynamic termination control
- Processing complex conditional judgments
- Modeling real-world quality improvement processes

## Complete Initialization (Clean Start)

Delete variables.json if it exists
Clear all TODO list items

Display "=== Quality Improvement System Started ===".

## Variable Initialization

Set {{quality_score}} to 45
Set {{improvement_cycle}} to 0
Set {{improvement_history}} to empty

## Loop Task Creation

Add the following task pair to TODO list up to 8 times:
- Execute one quality improvement cycle
- If {{quality_score}} is 85 or above, delete remaining tasks and terminate

## Execution

Execute TODO list tasks sequentially from top

For each "Execute one quality improvement cycle" task:

1. Add 1 to {{improvement_cycle}}
2. Display "=== Improvement Cycle {{improvement_cycle}} Started ==="
3. Display "Current quality score: {{quality_score}}"

4. Execute adaptive improvement processing:
   - If {{quality_score}} is below 60:
     → Display "Executing basic quality improvement"
     → Add 15 to {{quality_score}}
     → Append "Basic improvement +15 points" to {{improvement_history}}
   
   - If {{quality_score}} is 60 or above but below 75:
     → Display "Executing intermediate quality improvement"
     → Add 10 to {{quality_score}}
     → Append "Intermediate improvement +10 points" to {{improvement_history}}
   
   - If {{quality_score}} is 75 or above but below 85:
     → Display "Executing advanced quality improvement"
     → Add 6 to {{quality_score}}
     → Append "Advanced improvement +6 points" to {{improvement_history}}

5. Display "Post-improvement score: {{quality_score}}"
6. Display "=== Improvement Cycle {{improvement_cycle}} Completed ==="

## Final Quality Report

After all TODO tasks complete:

Display "=== Quality Improvement Complete Report ===".

Report the following improvement results:
- Initial quality score: 45
- Final quality score: {{quality_score}}
- Improvement cycles executed: {{improvement_cycle}}
- Improvement history: {{improvement_history}}
- Quality improvement rate: Calculate and display

Summarize quality improvement effectiveness analysis and future continuous improvement proposals.

## Execution Example and Expected Results

**Initial State**: Quality score 45, Improvement cycle 0
**Goal**: Quality score 85 or above
**Expected Execution Pattern**: 
- Cycle 1: 45→60 (basic improvement, continue)
- Cycle 2: 60→70 (intermediate improvement, continue)
- Cycle 3: 70→76 (advanced improvement, continue)
- Cycle 4: 76→82 (advanced improvement, continue)
- Cycle 5: 82→88 (advanced improvement, condition met! delete remaining tasks)

**Technical Features**: 
- Efficient score improvement through adaptive improvement processing
- Real-world modeling including complex conditional branches
- Reliable goal achievement detection through dynamic termination control
- Complete traceability through improvement history
