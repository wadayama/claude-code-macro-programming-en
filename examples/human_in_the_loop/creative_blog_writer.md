# Creative Blog Article Creation System (Human-in-the-Loop - Beginner)

## Step 1: Theme Proposal and Direction Confirmation

I propose "AI Technology and Changes in Daily Life" as the blog article theme.

Is it acceptable to proceed with the following article theme?
- Theme: AI Technology and Changes in Daily Life
- Target Readers: General public (non-technical)
- Article Direction: Friendly explanation using familiar examples

Please provide instructions if you have any modifications or changes.
If this theme is acceptable, please respond with "Approved".

Set your approval to {{theme_approval}}.

## Step 2: Article Structure Proposal

If {{theme_approval}} is "Approved", I propose the following basic structure:

1. **Introduction**: The familiar presence of AI technology
2. **Section 1**: Examples of AI utilization in smartphones
3. **Section 2**: AI utilization at home (smart speakers, appliances)
4. **Section 3**: Expanding AI utilization in work
5. **Conclusion**: Future prospects and message to readers

Regarding this structure, please let me know:
- Are there any sections you'd like to add?
- Are there any areas you'd like to emphasize?
- Is there a particular message you'd like to convey to readers?

Set your structure feedback to {{structure_feedback}}.

## Step 3: Adding Creative Ideas

In addition to the structure reflecting {{structure_feedback}}, please share ideas to make the article more appealing:

**Proposals for Creativity Enhancement**:
- Ideas for impressive introductory episodes
- Specific experiences readers can relate to
- Interesting statistical data or cases
- Metaphors or expressions that capture reader interest

Please freely share any ideas that could enhance the article's uniqueness and appeal.

Set your creative ideas to {{creative_ideas}}.

## Step 4: Article Writing

Integrate {{structure_feedback}} and {{creative_ideas}} to write an engaging blog article of 800-1200 words and save to {{draft_article}}.

Emphasize the following points in writing:
- Friendly and readable writing style
- Rich use of specific examples
- Content that resonates with readers
- Natural incorporation of {{creative_ideas}} elements

## Step 5: Safety and Quality Verification

Verify {{draft_article}} from the following perspectives:

**Content Verification**:
- Are there any factual errors?
- Are there any expressions that could cause misunderstanding?
- Is there any inappropriate or biased content?

**Quality Verification**:
- Is readability sufficient?
- Does it have a logical structure?
- Is it valuable content for readers?

If there are problems, please provide specific revision instructions.
If there are no problems, please respond with "Final Approval".

Set your quality verification results to {{final_approval}}.

## Step 6: Final Output and Recording

Only if {{final_approval}} is "Final Approval", please execute the following:
