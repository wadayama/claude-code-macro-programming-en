# Adaptive Learning System (Conditional Execution - Beginner)

## Learner Level Assessment
Please ask about learning experience in "Programming" and save the experience level to {{learner_level}}.

## Personalized Curriculum Provision
Execute the following based on {{learner_level}}:

For beginners (no experience or less than 6 months):
→ Please research learning materials for programming basics, variables, conditional statements, and loops, and save to {{beginner_curriculum}}

For intermediate learners (6 months to 2 years):
→ Please research learning materials for functions, classes, data structures, and small-scale project development, and save to {{intermediate_curriculum}}

For advanced learners (2+ years):
→ Please research learning materials for algorithms, design patterns, and architecture, and save to {{advanced_curriculum}}

## Learning Plan Creation
Based on the selected curriculum, please create a detailed 3-month learning schedule.

## Progress Management Proposal
Please propose learning progress measurement methods and achievement verification methods appropriate for {{learner_level}}.

**Learning Points**:
- Simple 3-level conditional branching
- Saving to different variables for each condition
- Personalized response based on learner situation
- Utilizing conditional branching results in subsequent processing
- Understanding basic patterns of Conditional Execution

**Conditional Execution Pattern Characteristics**:
1. **Decision Points**: Clear criteria for branching (experience levels)
2. **Path Specialization**: Each branch leads to tailored content and variables
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: System responds differently based on user characteristics
4. **Context Preservation**: Chosen path influences all subsequent processing
5. **Scalable Logic**: Easy to extend with additional experience levels or criteria

This example demonstrates how Conditional Execution enables personalized learning experiences by adapting content and approach based on individual learner characteristics and needs.
