# Academic Research Pipeline (Sequential Pipeline - Intermediate)

## Research Theme Setting
Save "Impact of Generative AI on Education" as the research theme to {{research_theme}}, 
and save {{research_theme}} to research_theme.json.

## Hypothesis Construction
Please construct 3 research hypotheses about {{research_theme}} from the following perspectives and save them to {{hypotheses}}:
- Impact on learning effectiveness
- Changes in teacher roles
- Impact on learner creativity

## Literature Review
Investigate recent research papers and reports related to {{hypotheses}},
organize important findings, and save them to {{literature_review}}.

## Data Collection Planning
Based on {{literature_review}}, please design data collection methods necessary for hypothesis testing,
and save specific research methodologies to {{data_collection_plan}}.

## Preliminary Analysis
Following {{data_collection_plan}}, please execute preliminary analysis using available public data,
and save initial findings to {{preliminary_analysis}}.

## Report Creation
Integrate {{hypotheses}}, {{literature_review}}, and {{preliminary_analysis}},
and create a comprehensive research progress report.

**Learning Points**:
- Implementation of standard academic research process using Sequential Pipeline
- Complex information integration through multiple variable combinations
- Practice with realistic research themes
- Step-by-step quality improvement process

**Advanced Sequential Pipeline Features**:
1. **Persistent storage**: Using `research_theme.json` for data permanence
2. **Multi-variable integration**: Final report synthesizes multiple data streams
3. **Iterative refinement**: Each stage builds upon and refines previous work
4. **Real-world application**: Addresses current academic and practical concerns

This intermediate example demonstrates how Sequential Pipeline can handle complex, multi-stage research workflows that mirror real academic methodologies.
