# Large-Scale Research Report Creation System (Robust Sequential Pipeline - Advanced)

This macro implements a robust Sequential Pipeline using TODO lists for creating research reports that involve multiple large-scale tasks.

## System Overview

Create a comprehensive research report (approximately 8,000 words) on the theme "Challenges and Prospects of AI Technology Implementation in Society" in a systematic manner.

## Phase 1: Overall Project Planning and TODO Setup

Please use the TODO tool to create the following large-scale task list and manage the entire project:

1. 【Research Design】Setting basic research scope and creating information source list
2. 【Literature Review】Collection and analysis of academic papers, government documents, and industry reports
3. 【Current Status Analysis】Detailed investigation of current AI technology implementation in society
4. 【Challenge Extraction】Systematic organization of technical, social, and ethical challenges
5. 【Case Studies】In-depth analysis of success and failure cases (3+ each)
6. 【Future Prospects】Prediction of technology and social trends for the next 5-10 years
7. 【Report Structure】Detailed design of overall structure (chapters, sections, logical framework)
8. 【Writing & Integration】Writing each chapter and overall integration
9. 【Verification & Improvement】Verification and improvement of logical consistency and data accuracy

Please execute each TODO task sequentially while confirming completion as you progress.

## Phase 2: 【Research Design】Basic Research Scope Setting

Please start the first task on the TODO list.

Please save the following research design to {{research_design}}:

### Research Scope Definition
- **Primary Focus**: Current implementation status and challenges of AI technology in society
- **Geographic Scope**: Global perspective with emphasis on developed countries
- **Temporal Scope**: 2020-2025 current status, 2025-2035 prospects
- **Sectoral Focus**: Healthcare, education, finance, transportation, manufacturing

### Information Sources Strategy
- **Academic Sources**: Peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings
- **Government Sources**: Policy documents, regulatory frameworks, implementation reports
- **Industry Sources**: Corporate reports, market analysis, technology assessments
- **Media Sources**: Technology journalism, expert commentary, case studies

### Quality Criteria
- **Recency**: Priority on sources from 2022-2025
- **Authority**: Recognized institutions, established researchers, official government sources
- **Diversity**: Multiple perspectives and stakeholder viewpoints
- **Verification**: Cross-reference claims across multiple sources

Please mark the first TODO task as completed and proceed to the next phase.

## Phase 3: 【Literature Review】Academic and Official Source Collection

Please mark the literature review task as in-progress on your TODO list.

Based on {{research_design}}, please conduct comprehensive literature review and save findings to {{literature_review}}:

### Academic Literature Focus Areas
1. **Implementation Frameworks**: How organizations approach AI adoption
2. **Success Metrics**: Quantitative and qualitative measures of successful AI implementation
3. **Barrier Analysis**: Common obstacles and resistance factors
4. **Ethical Considerations**: Privacy, bias, transparency, accountability frameworks
5. **Regulatory Landscape**: Current and proposed governance approaches

### Key Findings Organization
Please structure findings by:
- **Technical challenges** (scalability, integration, performance)
- **Social challenges** (acceptance, displacement, equity)
- **Economic factors** (cost-benefit, ROI, market dynamics)
- **Regulatory issues** (compliance, governance, standards)

Please mark literature review as completed and continue with the next TODO task.

## Phase 4: 【Current Status Analysis】Implementation Status Investigation

Please update your TODO list and begin current status analysis.

Using {{literature_review}} as foundation, please analyze current AI implementation status and save to {{current_status}}:

### Implementation Maturity Assessment
- **Healthcare**: Diagnostic tools, treatment optimization, administrative automation
- **Education**: Personalized learning, assessment automation, content generation
- **Finance**: Risk assessment, fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, traffic optimization, logistics
- **Manufacturing**: Predictive maintenance, quality control, supply chain optimization

### Adoption Patterns
- **Early adopters** vs. **mainstream adoption**
- **Geographic variations** in implementation speed and approach
- **Sector-specific factors** influencing adoption rates

Mark current status analysis as completed and proceed.

## Phase 5: 【Challenge Extraction】Systematic Challenge Organization

Please update TODO status and begin challenge extraction.

Based on {{literature_review}} and {{current_status}}, systematically organize challenges and save to {{challenges}}:

### Technical Challenges
1. **Scalability**: Infrastructure requirements for large-scale deployment
2. **Integration**: Legacy system compatibility and data migration
3. **Performance**: Reliability, accuracy, and consistency requirements
4. **Security**: Cybersecurity and data protection in AI systems

### Social Challenges
1. **Acceptance**: Public trust and user adoption barriers
2. **Employment**: Job displacement and workforce transition
3. **Equity**: Digital divide and access inequality
4. **Privacy**: Personal data use and surveillance concerns

### Governance Challenges
1. **Regulation**: Keeping pace with rapid technological development
2. **Standards**: International coordination and compatibility
3. **Accountability**: Responsibility assignment in AI decision-making
4. **Transparency**: Explainability and audit requirements

Mark challenge extraction as completed.

## Phase 6: Continuing with Remaining Phases

Please continue working through your TODO list systematically:
- Case Studies (success/failure analysis)
- Future Prospects (trend prediction)
- Report Structure (comprehensive organization)
- Writing & Integration (final report compilation)
- Verification & Improvement (quality assurance)

Each phase should build upon previous results while maintaining the TODO list for progress tracking.

**Learning Points**:
- **Large-scale project management** using TODO tool for complex, multi-phase work
- **Robust Sequential Pipeline** with verification and quality control at each stage
- **Variable dependency management** across multiple processing stages
- **Real-world application** addressing current technology and society challenges
- **Systematic approach** to comprehensive research and analysis

This advanced example demonstrates how Sequential Pipeline can handle enterprise-level research projects with multiple stakeholders, complex dependencies, and rigorous quality requirements.
