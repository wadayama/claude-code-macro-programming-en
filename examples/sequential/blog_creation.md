# Blog Article Creation System (Sequential Pipeline - Beginner)

## Topic Setting
Save "2025 Technology Trends" as the blog article topic to {{topic}}.

## Background Research
Research the latest information about {{topic}} on the web and save 5 noteworthy technologies to {{research_data}}.

## Article Structure Creation
Based on {{research_data}}, create a reader-friendly blog article structure (introduction, 3 main sections, conclusion) and save it to {{article_structure}}.

## Article Writing
Following {{article_structure}}, write an engaging blog article of 800-1200 words and save it to {{draft_article}}.

## Proofreading and Completion
Proofread {{draft_article}} and create a final version that improves readability, accuracy, and appeal.

**Learning Points**:
- Typical Sequential Pipeline where each stage depends on the previous stage's results
- Information passing through variables
- Specific task instructions using natural language
- Use of concrete, executable themes

**Sequential Pipeline Pattern Characteristics**:
1. **Linear dependency**: Each step requires the output of the previous step
2. **Variable chaining**: {{topic}} → {{research_data}} → {{article_structure}} → {{draft_article}} → final output
3. **Progressive refinement**: Raw topic → research → structure → draft → polished article
4. **Clear milestones**: Each stage has a definable completion point

This example demonstrates how complex content creation can be broken down into manageable, sequential steps using natural language macro programming.
